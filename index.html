  <h2>Running: An Introduction</h2>
  <p>Running has long been a popular exercise for the people of Sheffield, despite its hilly terrain and very windy weather for half of the year.
   </p>

  <p>The stunning views offered by the Peak District, and even the historic architecture of the inner city itself,
    provide perfect scenery for any running route, no matter how short or how far. </p>

<p>The population of Sheffield is made up by many students due to its two universities, so events like the Colour Run,
  combining exercise with some well-earned fun, become more popular every year.</p>
<p>Many people would not guess it but Sheffield is also known for its high amount of parks and green areas in the city itself, and these provide the perfect venues for fun runs, for all ages and abilities,
  which you can find almost every week in a park somewhere in the city. </p>

<h2>Challenging yet rewarding</h2>
<p>
The atmosphere surrounding the Plusnet Yorkshire Half Marathon-Sheffield was buzzing far before the race had started.
</p>
<p>You could almost taste the excitement in the air as organizers led participants through an energetic warm up, dancing around to music blaring out through countless speakers around the area near Arundel Gate, the starting point for the race.
 </p>
  <p>BBC’s Look North anchorman Harry Gration was at the scene, and participants were given the opportunity to give him a high five as they started their grueling run.
</p>

<p>
The route took the participants into the Peak District via Ecclesall Road, and they soon found themselves faced with the most challenging part of the race: the climb up along Ringinglow Road.
</p>

  <p>However, for those who managed to make it to the end of the five mile climb, a stunning view of the Peak District was to be found along Sheephill Road.
 </p>
    <p>The remainder of the course was a steady descent back towards Town Hall.
</p>

<p>
As the crowd stood by with eager eyes, John Franklin steadily trotted over the finish line with a time of 70 minutes and 24 seconds. Barely 30 seconds behind him was Dave Archer, completing the race in 70mins and 50secs, while Robert Ton followed in third place with 71mins 16 secs.
</p>

<p>
  In the women’s category, Zanthe Wray completed the race in 83mins 12secs, while Jenny Evans came in at 85mins 42secs. Kate Hastings made third place with 86mins 49secs.

  <h2>Bringing colour to Sheffield
</h2>
<p>
On the morning of April 30, hundreds of students from both of Sheffield’s universities gathered in the cold, ready to run and be splattered with paint.
</p>
<p>
  This year, Sheffield hosted the second annual Student Colour Run, an untimed 5k race in which runners have colourful, plant-based paints thrown at them before, during and after the run.
</p>
<p>The race is aimed at people of all abilities, encouraging people to "run, walk, or skip" depending on their skill level.
</p>

<p>
  The event began at South Street Park, an amphitheatre which overlooks the train station and city centre, then continued through the Park Hill flats and along a ridge which overlooks the entire city.

</p>
<p>
  Runners circled back and finished at the amphitheatre, where they were doused in more paint and danced to live DJs on the stage.
</p>
<p>Jimmy May and Chris Arnold both hosted and DJed at the event. Each has hosted colour runs in both Lincoln and Liverpool, but they said Sheffield was the best one yet.
</p>
<blockquote class="left">
"If you add the little element of fun that was there today, you inspire people."</blockquote>
<p>May said: “Today really surpassed all expectations. There were so many people, 1400 people I think there were today.”
</p>
<p>“It’s a bit more interesting to do a run like this cause there’s a bit of dancing both before and afterwards and other things that sort of inspire you to run rather than just being like ‘oh I’ll just go running.’”
</p>
<p>Arnold said: “I think the number one thing putting people off running is the fact that they find it boring, so I think if you add the little element of fun that was there today, you inspire people.”
</p>
<p>  In addition to encouraging people to get outside and be active, the Colour Run also donated one pound to a Sheffield University or Sheffield Hallam RAG charity for every ticket sold.

    <h2>Why you should run</h2>
  </header>
  </section>

  <section class="content">



  <p>
    We are told over and over again that exercise is good for us, with the government advising at least 30 minutes a day and the constant pressure from advertisements for the perfect toned body.
  </p>

<p>
  However there are lots of benefits to an active lifestyle that many of us don’t know about or fully understand.
</p>

<p>
  Running is a prime example of this, as some of the perks are well-known and others a bit more unusual.
</p>

<p>
  If we look back at our ancestry, we can see long distance running was crucial for good health. Survival relied on persistence hunting, so those with better stamina had more to eat and were therefore stronger.
</p>


<p>
  Obviously today supermarkets, cars and online shopping means very little fitness is needed to get food, but that doesn’t mean cardio fitness is redundant. Running is a perfect way of ensuring strong bones, it improves lung function, raises the level of good cholesterol and improves the immune system.
</p>

<p>
  Running also reduces the risk of a lot of diseases. For example someone is far less likely to suffer from strokes, heart attacks, diabetes and high blood pressure if they run regularly. It’s also one of the best forms of exercise to maintain a healthy weight.
</p>

<p>
  Running is the ideal sport in terms of convenience, as it’s possible to do almost anywhere and is significantly cheaper than a lot of sports. It’s also a great way of meeting new people by joining local running clubs. These factors mean that running can be great for an individual’s social health. The social aspect of running can mean people can become part of a community, where they otherwise may have felt isolated.
</p>

<p>
  Keen runners often talk about the “runners high”, and although this might seem like a made up effect, there is scientific evidence that shows why runners experience this uplifting mood. There are chemicals in the brain that are linked to depression and build up during times of stress. One of these chemicals is called Kynurenine and when we do aerobic exercise it is removed from the body. It’s also believed that exercise releases serotonin in the brain and this can uplift mood.
</p>

<p>
  Strangely enough our intellectual health can also be improved by exercise such as running. There is a single protein in the body that is responsible for releasing energy to both the muscles and brain. By improving your running ability, it improves your body’s ability to produce this protein. Therefore more energy can be released to the brain, which will improve memory and learning.
</p>

<p>
  There is also evidence to show that individuals with better cardiorespiratory fitness had better hearing function. So by running regularly and improving cardio fitness, this is likely to also improve your hearing.

  <p>
The drive for charity in the city is also extremely strong, and many running races are organised and set up to help people raise money for charities working in all different sectors throughout Sheffield.
  </p>
  <p>
The Yorkshire Half Marathon is one which is rich in runners raising hundreds and thousands for charities, as well as the famous Race for Life taking place in Meadowhall on Sunday July 3, filled with runners of all ages raising money to help beat Cancer.
  </p>
<p> The Big Fun Run is another 5k race aimed at single or group runner who want to improve their fitness whilst helping the community, taking place at Rother Valley County Park on Sunday August 14 this year.
